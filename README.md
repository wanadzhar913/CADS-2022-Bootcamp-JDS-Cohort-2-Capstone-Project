## JDS Cohort 2/2022 Capstone: Target Market Analysis

For the capstone, I was provided with information on customers' historical purchase records. For example, the dataset `data.csv` details information such as the amount of money spent, number of inactive months, whether they made a purchase or not and so on.

## Objectives

1. Design a **predictive model to determine potential customers that will make a purchase** if we send them advertisement. The target variable here is `Potential_Customer`. 
2. The model will then be **benchmarked against the default option where we simply send advertisements to everybody.** Given the cost of sending one advertisement (`c = 5`) and average purchase of MYR14.56, we'll need to see if the overall revenue of our model can exceed the default revenue of MYR1463.00.

## Findings
